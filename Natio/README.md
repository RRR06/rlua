# Install
Just download Natio.lua, and execute that in your injector. (Note that SynapseX is the best thing to use) 
Or just load in the raw of Natio.lua using a url; or use a load string if your injector supports it; ``` loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RRR06/rlua/master/Natio/Natio.lua", true))() ```
