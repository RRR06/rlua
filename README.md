## My projects
- DommedSpire, made for Doomspire Brickbattle (https://www.roblox.com/games/1215581239/Doomspire-Brickbattle), it has the function to tp only, but you can load in more plugins from da top right, I recommend to load in from the dedicated buttons, as these load in projects which may be slightly different from they're original counterparts
- Natio is a small project which uses SynapseX to show you both graphically and in the console a user's nation. Since its a small project its more supposed to be a module, but it needs some touch ups b4 it is what I want it to be
# Hey, remixing my projects? Then please read below
If ur gonna use my project in anyway, u must always include the link to the original version, or credit me, this can be accomplished either by a print("") or anywhere else, as long as you do what I just said
