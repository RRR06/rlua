# Compatability, works only with Synapse X!

UiTemplate is a template showing how the API can work...

# Using it
Usage really works with Synapse, but u can modify it to work with other injectors, feel free to use it in any project, you don't have to credit me but would be cool :)
Inject UiApi.lua before using any scripts that work with this...
